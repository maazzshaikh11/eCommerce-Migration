## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a single architectural decision: the context, the options considered, the decision, and the consequences. ADRs are immutable once accepted — superseded decisions are marked as such and a new ADR is created.

## Format

Each ADR follows:

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Title

## Status
Accepted | Superseded by ADR-NNN | Deprecated

## Context
Why this decision was needed.

## Decision
What was decided.

## Consequences
What follows from this decision.
```
